I just noticed this: [Language Designers
Wanted](http://www.rubyflow.com/items/11157-language-designers-wanted).
It announces [rattler](https://github.com/jarhart/rattler), yet
another PEG for Ruby.

I don't have time to look at it now, so this is really just a bookmark
for when "later" happens and I check it out.

However, a quick look shows that it is an external DSL.  Those can
have advantages and disadvantages.  The acid test of any parser,
though, is how well it handles crazy things like Fortran's Hollerith
constant, where you precede a string with the count of how many
characters are in it, and then a `H`:

{% highlight fortran %}
 10   FORMAT (1X, 5HHELLO)
{% endhighlight %}

This is the format statement you might use to print "HELLO".  This
crazy syntax goes all the way back to Fortran I, and is still
supported in Fortran77, so a FORTRAN compiler has to be able to handle
it.

When I do get around to looking at Rattler, this will be one of the
things I want to know: Can it change its parsing behavior based on
some prior parse node?  Can it use the count to know how many
characters are in the string?
